        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Save the Children was the first global movement for children, boldly declaring that children have rights. Today, we champion the rights of the world’s 2.3 billion children.</h3>
     <p>In the Bangladesh and around the world, we work every day to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn, and protection from harm. When crisis strikes and children are most vulnerable, we are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. We do whatever it takes for children - every day and in times of crisis – transforming their lives and the future we share.</p>
